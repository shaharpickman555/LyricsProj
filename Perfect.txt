I found a love for me
Darling, just die right in
Follow my lead
I found a girl
Beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone
Waiting for me
Because we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding my hand
